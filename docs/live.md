# Live control

`gdh live` starts a game off-screen and drives it one command at a time. The game is held between commands, so no game time passes while you, or an agent, look at a screenshot and decide what to do next.

```sh
gdh live start --project path/to/game            # main scene, held at frame 0
gdh live step 30 --hold ui_right --shot          # run 30 frames holding right, then save a frame
gdh live tree Player                             # inspect nodes
gdh live eval "get_node('Player').velocity"      # read any value
gdh live probes                                  # run the probes on the current frame
gdh live stop
```

A C# project is built with `dotnet build` first and run with `godot-mono` (README, "C# projects"). Arguments after `--` go to the game: `gdh live start --project path/to/game -- --server ws://localhost:8787` gives the game exactly `["--server", "ws://localhost:8787"]` from `OS.get_cmdline_user_args()`. The harness's own settings travel in the `GDH_ARGS` environment variable, so they never mix with the game's.

Nothing is installed into the project. `gdh` runs Godot with `--script src/gdh/harness/live.gd`, which loads the scene and attaches the control node `bridge.gd`. The project's autoloads load as usual. The control node is an internal child of the root, so game code that walks `root.get_children()` doesn't see it.

## Time

- The game starts held at game frame 0. The scene's `_ready` has run, and no `_process` or `_physics_process` has.
- `step N` runs exactly N frames, then holds again. Godot is launched with `--fixed-fps` set to the project's physics tick rate, so each frame is exactly one physics tick of game time, however long it takes to render.
- The frame number in every reply counts game frames only. Frames rendered while held don't count.
- `run` lets the game run at about real time until `pause`.
- Holding uses `SceneTree.paused`. It has these side effects:
  - Nodes whose process mode is `ALWAYS` or `WHEN_PAUSED` keep running while held. `status` lists them.
  - If the game unpauses itself while held, `gdh` pauses it again and says so in the next reply.

## Input

Input is injected at the start of a step, where real input arrives. `_input`, `is_action_just_pressed` and `is_action_pressed` see it the same way they see a player's input. An input is either an action name from the Input Map or `key:NAME` for a key (for example `key:Space`). A key goes through the Input Map like a real key press.

| Option | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--press INPUT` | Press at the start of the step, and keep it pressed after |
| `--release INPUT` | Release at the start of the step |
| `--hold INPUT` | Press at the start, release at the end |
| `--tap INPUT` | Press for one frame |
| `--click X,Y` | Left click at screenshot pixel X,Y |

Each option can be repeated.

## Coordinates

Every position `gdh` accepts or reports is in screenshot pixels: clicks, the `screen` field in `tree`, and probe `screen_rect`s. So you can click where a screenshot or `tree` shows something, whatever the project's stretch settings are. Tests cover stretch modes `viewport` and `canvas_items`.

`tree` also reports `pos`, which is the node's global position in world units.

## Seeing the game

| Command | Output |
|---|---|
| `shot [--view V]... [--label L] [--tiles]` | PNGs of the current frame, in any capture view |
| `step N --shot-every K` | A frame every K frames during the step, to catch flicker, popping and jitter |
| `step N --shot` | A frame after the step |
| `probes` | Probe findings on the current frame, with crops |
| `tree [PATH] [--depth N]` | Nodes with class, script, world position, screen position (`[x, y]`, or `[x, y, w, h]` for a Control), text, value, velocity and animation |
| `eval EXPR` | Any Godot expression. The base is the current scene. `scene`, `tree`, `root`, each autoload by name and the engine's singletons (`OS`, `Engine`, `Input`, `Time`, `RenderingServer` and the rest) are also available. |
| `status` | Game frame, held or running, scene, nodes that run while held |

Screenshots go to `./captures/live/<session>/shots/`, or to `--out` if given. Every reply lists the engine errors raised since the previous reply, with repeats merged. Add `--json` to any command for the raw reply.

## Sessions

- **Several games at once:** `--session NAME` runs more than one game side by side. The default name is `default`.
- **Session files:** each is kept in `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/gdh/` and can be read only by you. It holds the port and a random token that every request must carry. The game gets the token through its environment, which other users can't read. Keeping it off the command line keeps it out of the process list.
- **Local only:** the game listens on 127.0.0.1.
- **Idle timeout:** a game quits after 30 minutes without a request. Change this with `--idle-timeout SECONDS`, or set 0 to turn it off.
- **Stopping:** `stop` asks the game to quit, then stops Xvfb and Godot if they're still running.
- **Crashed games:** if a game dies, the next command says so, shows the end of its log and removes the session.

## Protocol

One JSON object per line over TCP.

```json
{"id": 1, "token": "…", "cmd": "step", "args": {"frames": 30, "events": [{"action": "ui_right", "pressed": true, "at": 0}]}}
{"id": 1, "ok": true, "result": {…}, "errors": […], "frame": 30, "held": true}
```

The commands are `status`, `step`, `shot`, `probes`, `tree`, `eval`, `run`, `pause` and `quit`. In `step`, an event with `"at": k` is injected before frame k+1 of the step. Event forms:
- `{action, pressed, strength}`
- `{key, pressed}`
- `{mouse_button, position, pressed}`
- `{mouse_motion: [x, y]}`

## Tests

`uv run pytest` runs `tests/test_live.py` against `testbed/live/arena.tscn`. The tests need Godot, a GPU with Vulkan, and Xvfb. They check:

- exact frame counts and movement at 60 and 120 ticks per second
- that taps reach `_physics_process`, `_process` and `_input` once each
- held input across steps
- button clicks at the positions `tree` reports, with no stretching and in both stretch modes
- screenshots, the tree, error reporting and the unpause note
- a bad scene, the idle timeout and cleanup after a crash
